<div id="p3">Popular for its Pokemon-Like appearance, Palworld is popular because of the controversy between it and pokemon, being in the making for a few years, people have wondered whether it would be immediately taken down by law suits from pokemon or not. Palworld is an upcoming action-adventure, survival, and monster-taming game created and published by Japanese developer Pocket Pair. The game is set in an open world populated with animal-like creatures called "Pals", which players can battle and capture to use for base building, traversal, and combat. </div>
